4. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a secure and modern web-based authentication system that allows users to register, log in, log out, reset passwords, and manage session-based access. The system aims to ensure the safety and integrity of user data using best practices in web security such as password hashing, API token protection, and access control.

The system will be used as a base layer for securing any web application that requires user identity verification and access restrictions.

5. Project Features

🔐 User Registration
Users can create a new account by providing a name, email, and password. The system validates inputs and securely stores hashed passwords.

🔓 Login System
Users can log in with their email and password. Tokens or sessions are used to authenticate API requests.

🔁 Password Reset
Forgot password functionality allows users to reset their password via an email confirmation link.

👤 Role-Based Access Control
The system supports multiple roles such as Admin, User, and potentially other roles, each with specific access permissions.

📦 Laravel Sanctum for API Security
The backend uses Laravel Sanctum to authenticate API requests, ensuring secure communication between frontend and backend.

⚙️ Frontend Integration with React.js
The frontend is built in React.js for a modern and responsive user interface. It connects to backend APIs for registration, login, and user actions.

🛡️ Security Best Practices
- Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt.
- CSRF protection is enabled.
- Session/token expiration and logout functionality included.
- Basic protection against brute-force login attempts.

📱 Responsive Design
Mobile-friendly forms and interface for better accessibility.
